# Persistent project context

## Project identity

Momey pre-formation revenue-validation static site: index.html + styles.css, no application build system.

## Sources of truth and startup

Read global/repo AGENTS → existing delivery contract → `CODEX_HANDOFF.md` → selected GitHub Issue / explicit user task → `git branch --show-current`, `git rev-parse HEAD`, `git status --short`, `git diff` (and staged diff). This repository has no standalone PROJECT_DELIVERY_RULES.md; retain the specific rules below and in the current handoff instead of inventing a duplicate.

Only `CODEX_HANDOFF.md` is current; older milestone handoffs are historical, not competing current entries. Supporting sources: `index.html`, `styles.css`.

## Accepted baseline and work contract

- Carry forward VERIFIED/ACCEPTED/COMPLETE/LOCKED_DECISION/CARRIED_FORWARD without reimplementation or repeat research absent counterevidence. Reopen only new evidence, invalidating HEAD, explicit changed requirement or refactor Issue; record OLD_BASELINE, NEW_EVIDENCE, SUPERSEDED_DECISION.
- One Issue is one bounded user flow with Goal, Scope, Acceptance Criteria, Evidence Required and Dependencies / Blockers. Do not reopen completed Issues or manufacture new work while blocked.
- Main agent executes by default; no automatic agents/model switching or fictitious reviewer identity. Two no-progress attempts for one hypothesis maximum, then reassess evidence/tool/environment.
- Claims: VERIFIED_BY_CODE, VERIFIED_BY_TEST, VERIFIED_BY_RUNTIME_OR_PRODUCTION, CARRIED_FORWARD, EVENT_PENDING, UNSUPPORTED. Historical evidence is not a fresh run.
- Blockers: CODE_DEFECT, VALIDATION_TOOL_DEFECT, ENVIRONMENT_DEFECT, EXTERNAL_WAIT, HUMAN_AUTHORIZATION, EVIDENCE_INSUFFICIENT. Complete only when the original acceptance criteria are evidenced; otherwise PARTIAL/BLOCKED with one resumption condition, no unsolicited polling.

## Commands and limitations

Install/build/lint/unit/integration: no commands are defined in this repository. Governance validation: git diff --check and reference existence. Browser validation applies only to separately authorized HTML/CSS changes.

Not incorporated, funded, revenue-generating or a production SaaS/security company. Draft-only/manual-first C2 concept; no compliance guarantee or automatic submission.

## Delivery

Update the single current handoff with CURRENT_HEAD/BRANCH, LAST_VERIFIED_STATE, COMPLETED / VERIFIED, ACTIVE_WORK, KNOWN_BLOCKERS, LOCKED_DECISIONS, EVENT_PENDING and NEXT_EXECUTABLE_ISSUE. Resolve actual HEAD using Git; recorded hashes identify evidence baselines, not a self-referential final documentation commit.

Preserve unrelated dirty work. Stage only reviewed task files; no reset/clean/force push/history rewrite. Separate source sync from release/deploy/account authorization. Commit and push the safe current branch; verify local and remote HEAD equality before claiming GITHUB_SYNC=PUSHED. If unavailable, retain the commit and report exact blocker. Documentation-only validation checks references, Markdown and diff, never reruns the product suite for ceremony.
